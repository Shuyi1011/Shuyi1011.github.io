I'm a MSIM student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I completed my Bachelor of Laws in Philosphy, Politics, Economics (PPE) degree at Renmin University of China.

My research interests focus on leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance human-computer interaction and educational tools. I explore multi-agent coordination, particularly in simulating real-world scenarios like collaborative learning. My work integrates advanced NLP technologies with practical applications in teaching, writing assistance, and dynamic user interaction platforms.
